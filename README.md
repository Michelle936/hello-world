# hello-world
This is my very first repository. This is a new skill that I am learning.
My name is Michelle and this is my very first commit within GitHub. I am very excited to be learning how to use this platform. I am sure this will come in handy throughout my career as a Software Engineer. I am self taught so this is going to be quite the journey. And I look forward to giving it my all every step of the way. Thanks GitHub Guides!
